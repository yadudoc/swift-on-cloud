Swift interface to the Clouds
-----------------------------

There are 3 core functions that the Cloud interface does:

submit : Submits a string for execution on a cloud instance.
               The string for execution will be the in the config file in the format :
               CMD_STRING="<string>"
               Once the job is submitted, cloud_submit will emit the string jobid=<uniq_jobid>
               Returns 0 on successful submission.

               If specification is incorrect, or an error occurred, the error message will go to stderr
               Error: codes, not defined.

status : Takes the unique ids of runs, and returns the status of job submitted to the cloud.
               Prints out following:
               <jobid> Q|R|C|F [ exitcode [<error message>] ]
                Q - Queued - Pending run
                R - Running
                C - Completed
                F - Failed optionally

cancel : Takes one jobid as an argument. Cancels/Terminates the job.


Examples:

./cloud.py cloud_submit configs <string>
./cloud.py cloud_status configs jobid1 jobid2
./cloud.py cloud_cancel configs jobid1
